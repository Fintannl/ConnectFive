# ConnectFive
Network Based Connect Five Game
To start the game simply start one instance of the ConnectFiveServer and two instances of the ConnectFiveClient (one for player1 and one for player2).
Then simply follow the on screen messages which indicate which player is to move next and if one or the other players has won or if the game is drawn.
Enjoy
